### Abstract:

The Aurignacian is the first European technocomplex assigned to Homo sapiens identified across a wide geographic extent. Although archaeologists have identified marked chrono-cultural shifts within the Aurignacian mostly by examining the techno-typological variations of stone tools, unraveling the underlying processes driving these modifications remains a significant scientific challenge. Scholars have for instance hypothesized that the Campanian Ignimbrite (CI) super-eruption and the climatic deterioration associated with the onset of Heinrich Event 4 had a substantial impact on European foraging groups. The technological shift from the Protoaurignacian to the Early Aurignacian is regarded as the archaeologically visible adaptation to changing environments. However, some of the most crucial regions and stratigraphic sequences for testing these scenarios have been overlooked. In this study, we delve into the high-resolution sequence of Grotta di Castelcivita in southern Italy. Here, the Uluzzian is followed by three Aurignacian layers that were sealed by the eruptive units of the CI. Employing a comprehensive range of quantitative methods—encompassing attribute analysis, 3D model analysis, and geometric morphometrics—we demonstrate that the technological features commonly associated with the Early Aurignacian developed well before the CI tephra deposition. Our study provides thus the first direct evidence that the volcanic eruption played no role in this cultural process. Furthermore, we show that local paleo-environmental proxies do not correlate with the identified patterns of cultural continuity and discontinuity. Consequently, we propose alternative research paths to explore the role of demography and regional trajectories in the formation of the Upper Paleolithic.

### Overview of contents and how to reproduce:

This repository contains several folders in which data (`data`), code (`scripts`), and figures (`figures`) for the paper are stored. The `data` contains the whole dataset, the core datasets, the derived data, and the 2D outlines used for the geometric morphometrics study. After downloading the complete repository, the results can be reproduced using `Castelcivita-Aur-Techno.Rproj` and the existing folder structure. In order to create a reproducible environment, I used the `renv` package (v. 1.0.3), following the steps outlined in its vignette. All analyses and visualisations presented in this paper were prepared in R 4.3.1 under Microsoft Windows 10.0.19045 (64-bit). Since the required packages can be found in the `renv` folder, I will not list them here.
